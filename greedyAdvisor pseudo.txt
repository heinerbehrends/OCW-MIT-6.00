greedyAdvisor(dict, maxWork, algor)
dictCopy = dict(dict)
workLimit = maxWork
res = dict

check if any items in dictCopy < workLimit:
	if none return dict
get best Value in regards with algor
	copy best value to res
	remove best value from dictCopy
	Subtract work value from workLimit
Start all over with new dict and new maxWork

Sub problem 1: 

check if any work value of dictCopy <= maxWork

Sub problem 2:

get best value according to comparator

Sub problem 3:

Add values to res
Delete values from copyDict
Subtract value from workLimit
